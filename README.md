## 📘 Go – The Complete Guide

**Course:** _Go – The Complete Guide_ by Maximilian Schwarzmüller (last updated April 2025) ([Udemy][1])
**Platform:** Udemy
**Overview:** A comprehensive course (15½ hours video + 9 articles) that teaches Go from fundamentals through advanced topics, including Goroutines, channels, data structures, and a REST API project.

---

### 🧰 What's Included

- **Intro & Setup:** Install Go, set up your environment.
- **Core Concepts:** Data types, control flow, pointers, structs, slices, maps, packages.
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines, channels, sync patterns.
- **Error Handling & Interfaces**
- **Real-World Projects:** Multiple demo apps, culminating in an authenticated REST API with SQL database.

---

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic programming concepts (variables, functions, data structures)
- No prior Go experience required ([Udemy][1])

### 🌱 What I’ve Learned So Far

- How to declare **variables**, **constants**, and use basic **control flow**
- Working with **nil**, zero-values, and the differences between slices & arrays
- Using **structs** to model data and implementing methods on types
- How **pointers** work, and passing by reference vs. value

---

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. Complete the **Concurrency** section with demo exercises (goroutines, channels, worker pools).
2. Develop the **REST API** project:

   - Model data with structs
   - Implement handlers, routing, and middleware
   - Persist data to a SQL DB (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL)

3. Explore additional topics: interfaces, testing, error handling, and packaging.

### 💡 Additional Resources

- Course GitHub repo with code snapshots and slides by the instructor ([GitHub][2])
- Official Go documentation at [golang.org](https://golang.org)
- Community: check out r/golang on Reddit for discussions and tips ([Reddit][3])

### ✅ How to Use This Repo

- **Track your progress:** Update the table as you complete sections.
- **Code for each section:** Save your code under folders like `01-setup/`, `02-basics/`, etc.
- **Add notes:** Write markdown summaries after finishing each section—what challenged you, what clicked.

### ✨ Tip

As you code along, don’t just replicate the instructor. **Experiment**! Try alternate approaches, tweak your code, or integrate third-party libraries. It’ll help solidify your understanding.
