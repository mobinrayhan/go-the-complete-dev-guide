Great job completing the Go Essentials module! ðŸŽ‰ You're building a solid foundation. Based on the topics you've covered (functions, variables, types, input/output, conditionals, loops, file handling, etc.), here are **five practical problems** to solve that match the flow of what youâ€™ve learned:

---

### âœ… 1. **Simple Budget Calculator**

**Objective:**
Write a program that takes the user's **monthly income** and **expenses**, then calculates:

- Savings
- Whether the user is spending more than they earn

**Requirements:**

- Use `fmt.Scan()` for input
- Use `if`, `else`, and `return`
- Output result with `fmt.Printf` using formatted floats

---

### âœ… 2. **Student Grade Evaluator**

**Objective:**
Ask the user for marks in 3 subjects, calculate average, and determine the grade:

- A if avg >= 80
- B if avg >= 70
- C if avg >= 60
- F if avg < 60

**Requirements:**

- Use functions with multiple return values
- Use `switch` or `if-else` conditions
- Format and display the result clearly

---

### âœ… 3. **Multiplication Table Generator**

**Objective:**
Take a number input and print its multiplication table (1 to 10).

**Requirements:**

- Use `for` loop
- Use formatted output
- Wrap logic in a function like `printMultiplicationTable(n int)`

---

### âœ… 4. **User Login System (Basic Auth Check)**

**Objective:**
Check if a given username and password match the predefined ones.

**Requirements:**

- Use `if`, `else`, `return`
- Use constants or variables for stored credentials
- Exit early if login fails

**Bonus:** Read credentials from a text file using file reading.

---

### âœ… 5. **Mini Invoice Writer (Write to File)**

**Objective:**
Take product name, quantity, and price from user, calculate total cost, and write a formatted invoice to a file.

**Requirements:**

- Use user input
- Use functions
- Use `os.Create` and `fmt.Fprintf` to write to a file
- Format float values properly

---

### How to Proceed

After completing these problems:

1. Let me know youâ€™re done âœ…
2. Iâ€™ll give you a short quiz or review based on your code if you want
3. Then weâ€™ll move to the next module with **control structures + slices, arrays, and more advanced features**

Would you like me to create a repo structure suggestion or template for you to solve these in order?
